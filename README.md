# Data structures

A little summary of some of the most commonly used data structures.  
Each data structure referenced here will be provided with a small example of
its implementation and a small readme to summarize its core logic.

## Referenced data structures

- [x] Static array
- [x] Queues
- [x] Stacks
- [ ] Heap (binary, etc.)
- [ ] More to come

## Contribution

Any contribution is welcome as long as you provide a minimal (and valid)
implementation of a data structure with its summary in a readme. See the `Contributing.md` file for more.

You are free to chose your language and you can also rewrite one of the
existing structure in another language of your choice.
