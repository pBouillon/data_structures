# Contributing

Any contribution is welcomed !  
For this, be sure that it is relevant; several pull requests may be needed for:

- Correct typos in various files;
- Add another language to existing implementations;
- Add a new data structure to this repository;
- Other, as long as it is documented in your PR.

## Adding a new data structure

There is juste too many of them, so it's pretty much sure that you may bring a new one in this repository. 
In order to do so, please create a new folder with the name of the data structure, with its associated `Readme.md` providing a 
small schema of the structure (when possible) and the complexity of the operations usually allowed by this type of structure.

Example: if you would like to add an array, please explain the complexity for addition, deletion, etc.

Of course, your implementation must allow the user to perform those operations !

## Adding your own implementation

If you want to add an implementation of a structure, first please be sure that someone didn't already coded this, otherwise you may 
prefer to improve his/her solution instead of duplicating the sources.

If no source file exists with the language you would like to add, then go for it !  
Don't forget to implement at least the operations defined in the structure's `Readme.md` and respect general coding guidelines.

## Creating a PR

Once you're done, please create the associated pull request to explain what are your changes or why they are relevant.  

Thank you for your contribution and happy coding !
